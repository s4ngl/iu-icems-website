### Our Mission
IC-EMS is a student organization comprised of certified EMT-basics and first aid personnel, all passionate about patient care. IC-EMS is also a state-certified, non-profit, BLS non-transport agency. The mission of IC-EMS is to educate and provide emergency medical care to the Indiana University community.

IC-EMS is privately hired by university departments, student organizations, and community organizations to provide comprehensive emergency medical care to event participants. We host CPR and First Aid American Heart Association Certification classes for our members and the general public, so no certifications are required to join.

The organization has a proud tradition of providing emergency medical service at major university events, including:
- Little 500 bicycle races
- IU Athletics events
- First Thursdays
- IU Dance Marathon (Riley Children's Hospital fundraiser)
