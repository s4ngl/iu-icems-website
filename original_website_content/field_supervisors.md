# Meet the Field Supervisors!

## Daniel Musapatika, EMT-B

I'm a senior majoring in Human Biology and minoring in Chemistry and Psychology. I joined IC-EMS my freshman year because I wanted to be a part of an organization where I could physically apply my medical knowledge and serve the IU community. I got my EMT-B certification the second semester of my sophomore year. Outside of IC-EMS, I am a UTIN for c-116, a member of Phi Delta Epsilon medical fraternity, a member of MAPS (Minority Association of Premedical Students), and a research technician for a microbiology lab. As for my hobbies, I like cooking, reading, working out, and playing video games. After graduation, I plan on attending medical school to potentially pursue a career somewhere in pediatric medicine.

## Kaitlyn Brake

I am a senior from Zionsville, Indiana majoring in Philosophy and Political Science with a minor in Ethics. I joined IC-EMS spring semester of my freshman year after hearing good things about the organization from other students in my EMT course. I decided to join in order to practice and build upon my EMT skills and get more involved around campus. On top of IC-EMS, I also volunteer as a TA in the EMT course on campus, work for IU Health LifeLine as an EMT, and work for the Rec Sports risk management team. When I'm not doing something EMT related I love playing cards, reading, going on walks/hikes, and playing with my cat. After graduation, I plan to pursue a career field studying human behavior and decision making.

## Dulce Withrow, EMT-B

I am a sophomore from Cincinnati, Ohio majoring in Human Biology with a concentration in Human Health and Disease and minors in Chemistry and Spanish. I joined IC-EMS the fall of my freshman year to gain real patient contact hours along with meeting people of similar interest. Once I heard about the club, I immediately signed up to be BLS/CPR & First Aid certified through a class provided by IC-EMS to volunteer for school events. And now I have recently gained my EMT-B over this past summer. Outside of IC-EMS, I am part of Phi Delta Epsilon and Med Life Club, where I volunteer within the community. I have thoroughly enjoyed meeting everyone in the club and growing my love of medicine. With that, I am striving to attend medical school in the future and becoming a Pediatric Ear, Nose and Throat specialist.

## Megan Mahon, EMT-B

I am a Sophomore from Carmel, Indiana. I'm studying Community Health with a minor in Global Health Promotion. I joined IU-ICEMS during my freshman year in the fall and got my EMT-B in the spring. I love the opportunities to work with the IU community through events and get hands-on patient contact. Outside of IC-EMS my favorite hobbies are running and reading. After graduation, I plan to pursue a Master of Public Health and work in the field of Public Health.

## Jadan Bourne

I am a Senior from South Dakota studying Biology. I have worked at LifeLine as an EMT for the past two years and thought that IC-EMS would be a good way to learn more and teach others. Outside of school and work, you can usually find me outside climbing, hiking, or lounging.
